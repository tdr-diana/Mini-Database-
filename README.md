# Mini-Database
Project Overview: Citizen Proposal Management System
This project implements a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) designed for administrative institutions. It digitizes the workflow of citizen proposals, ensuring transparency, data integrity, and a clear audit trail from submission to completion.

1.1 Objective
The primary goal is to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of public projects. The system acts as a "single source of truth" for administrative tracking, specifically focusing on:

Proposal Lifecycle Tracking: Capturing the transition from a citizen's initial idea to a formal project, including exact timestamps for every phase.

Opinion Management: Storing and organizing reviews, feedback, and departmental opinions for each proposal.

Financial & Resource Oversight: Managing detailed budget allocations and tracking the third-party companies responsible for project implementation.

Comprehensive Reporting: Automatically generating a final "Work Report" that summarizes the entire historical process, providing a full audit of every step taken.

Key Features
Historical Logging: Every stage change is recorded with precise dates to monitor administrative efficiency.

Stakeholder Mapping: Links citizens (proposers), administrators (reviewers), and companies (executors) to specific project IDs.

Budget Integrity: Securely stores financial data and allocation records for funded projects.
